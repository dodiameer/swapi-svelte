<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  This is an <a href="https://github.com/dodiameer/swapi-svelte"
    >open source project</a
  >
  built in an afternoon using Svelte, Typescript, URQL, and
  <a href="https://github.com/graphql/swapi-graphql"
    >the Star Wars API GraphQL Wrapper</a
  >. It isn't meant to be for Star Wars geeks and doesn't show you more
  information than you'd find in a simple Google search, but it's a good
  exersice for anyone looking to learn Svelte, Typescript, or GraphQL. The only
  missing feature is pagination, which will be left as an exersice for you. Feel
  free to clone the repo from GitHub and do anything with it, just make sure you
  change the API url to your own hosted one. Good luck!
